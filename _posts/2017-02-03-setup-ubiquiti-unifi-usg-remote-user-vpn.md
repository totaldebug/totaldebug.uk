I have recently had loads of trouble setting up a Ubiquiti UniFi USG remote user VPN, the USG requires a RADIUS server in order to function correctly, the following article covers this setup [freeRADIUS Setup](https://totaldebug.uk/posts/install-freeradius-centos-7-with-daloradius-for-management/)

Once RADIUS is setup the easy part is configuring the USG through the UniFi controller.

  1. First you will need to login to your UniFi Controller
  2. Go to the settingsÂ 
  3. Then select networks
  4. Create a new network
  5. Add a name for the VPN
  6. Select **Remote User VPN** for the Purpose
  7. Enter and IP Address with CIDR e.g. 192.168.10.1/24
  8. Enter the IP Address for your RADIUS Server
  9. Enter the port for your RADIUS Server (Default is 1812)
 10. Enter your RADIUS Servers Secret Key / Password
 11. Click Save

That is all you need to do!

> In version 5.3.11 and below P2TP is not supported which means it will not work with iPhones / iPads etc. this is supposed to be resolved in the next release.
