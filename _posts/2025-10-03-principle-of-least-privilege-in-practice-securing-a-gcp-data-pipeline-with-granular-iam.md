### **Idea 3: The Principle of Least Privilege in Practice**

This idea focuses on the numerous IAM and security resources (`google_project_iam_member`, `google_service_account`, `google_storage_bucket_iam_binding`, `google_compute_firewall`) from the perspective of a security professional. It provides practical, code-based advice that is highly valuable and demonstrates deep expertise.

*   **Title:** Principle of Least Privilege in Practice: Securing a GCP Data Pipeline with Granular IAM
*   **Summary:** Generic IAM advice is easy to find, but applying it to a real-world application is the hard part. This post is for DevOps and Security Engineers who want to move beyond theory. Using a serverless IoT data pipeline as our example, we will demonstrate how to craft precise IAM policies for Service Accounts, Cloud Storage buckets, and Eventarc triggers to ensure every component has only the permissions it absolutely needs to function.
