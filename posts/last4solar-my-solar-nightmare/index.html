I then found YouTube recommendations for a local company that had brilliant TrustPilot reviews, they had been around for quite some time and their website was very informative</p><p>Most other companies I saw looked like a single person outfit which for me wasn’t really an ideal option as aftercare may become an issue especially if they retire or stop doing solar. in hindsight this shouldn’t have been a deciding factor.</p><p>At this point I had decided that I would go with <strong>First4Solar</strong>, they were the clear winners in price and the initial delivery…</p><h2 id="the-quoting-process"><span class="me-2">The quoting process</span><a href="#the-quoting-process" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2><p>After getting in touch with First4Solar they asked some initial questions:</p><ol><li>What our yearly power consumption was<li>The orientation of our roof<li>Where we would like the panels<li>If we wanted battery storage and how much<li>What access was like to the roofs</ol><p>I told them all of this, additionally asking for automated whole house failover in case of a grid failure and as many panels as possible on the roof along with around 11kw batteries.</p><p>So far so good.</p><p>Until I got the first quote, which didn’t match what I had asked for, I assumed that this was just a miss-communication, they had provided a quote for a standard package:</p><ul><li>16x 415W Jinko N-Type Panels<li>GivEnergy 9.5kWh Battery with 100% DOD<li>3.6kW Charge / Discharge<li>Can be used with off-peak tariffs<li>Emergency Power Supply Compatible (manual)</ul><p>The issue I had with this was I wanted as many panels as possible on the roof, which this didn’t do, when adding the extra panels, the GivEnergy inverter wasn’t powerful enough, it would basically be at full capacity based on the above, and in my eyes its always better to have a bigger inverter to support the addition of more panels or other technology in the future, there was no growing room here which again wasn’t what I requested.</p><p>Part of their reasoning for using the GivEnergy inverter was that its under 3.6kWh which means no DNO G99 application is required speeding up the process.</p><p>I then asked for a custom quote that doesn’t follow the standard package, they then quoted for the following:</p><ul><li>24x Jinko Tiger 415W N-Type Black Framed Mono<li>SolaX G4 7.5kW Hybrid Inverter<li>SolaX Triple Power HV 5.8kWh (Master) V2<li>SolaX Triple Power HV 5.8kWh (Slave) V2<li>EPS - Manual Changeover</ul><p>Again you can see they didn’t add the automated failover, however they did say that if the power draw of the house was higher than the inverter could handle, it would stop until the load dropped, which I agreed made sense as I could shut off none essential items, but not really what I wanted as I have servers to keep running.</p><p>In the end this second quote is what I went with after they persuaded me that it was best, I guess they were the experts so I would go with their recommendation.</p><h2 id="paying-the-deposit"><span class="me-2">Paying the deposit</span><a href="#paying-the-deposit" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2><p>Now we are at the stage of paying the deposit, all seemed good and even the director called me to explain the process and to get my deposit paid ASAP to not miss my install date. So I called to try pay by card but “the card machine wasn’t working” and they recommend paying by BACS anyway. At the time I thought nothing of it, so I transferred the money via BACS.</p><p>This was the first mistake that I made, however I was totally unaware at the time.</p><p>The second mistake was believing being told once paid I would automatically be registered with HEIS so my deposit would be secure and covered by the HEIS insurance, which turned out not to be the case and I should have been contacted by HEIS.</p><h2 id="radio-silence"><span class="me-2">Radio Silence</span><a href="#radio-silence" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2><p>After paying the deposit (7th Dec 2022) I had total radio silence, If I contacted them the person I needed was “on another call” or “off sick” or one of many other excuses.</p><p>I finally managed to speak with someone who gave me an install date of 4th &amp; 5th May 2023, which they would later call and re-arrange for the 18th &amp; 19th May 2023.</p><p>I then received a further call to re-arrange again, but told them if they moved the install date I would cancel the order and go elsewhere. After this I never heard from them again.</p><p>There was no mention of the DNO G98/99 application and the install was about two weeks off, so again I tried contacting them around ten times which eventually got me through to someone who said it was in hand and they were waiting for the DNO to get back to them, I have contacted the DNO to see if they got the application and am currently awaiting a call back, although I suspect that there was never an application sent.</p><h2 id="concern-starts-to-set-in"><span class="me-2">Concern starts to set in</span><a href="#concern-starts-to-set-in" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2><p>Other family members were also having issues, dates being set back and different excuses every time. After a while the bad reviews started to pour into <a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/first4solar.co.uk">TrustPilot</a> at this point I knew something was wrong and began to try get a refund, but all the phones had stopped working and were going to automated systems, even though surprisingly the sales line was still working and deposits were still being taken from customers!</p><p>I never got a refund and never spoke to another person at F4S, I did find a facebook group with hundreds of people who were having the exact same issues.</p><h2 id="is-this-fraud"><span class="me-2">Is this fraud?</span><a href="#is-this-fraud" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2><p>The company took my deposit at a point where they must have known they were trading insolvent, but continued to take people’s money, I have heard from other customers that their credit cards were used to pay other suppliers of F4S.</p><p>Raised with HEIS who I found out I was not registered and so my £3.5k was not covered by their insurance and I would need to take this up with the bank, the bank also would not touch this as I made a BACS payment (an expensive mistake to make)</p><h2 id="the-takeover"><span class="me-2">The Takeover</span><a href="#the-takeover" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2><p>So now we are at a state where i’m 3.5k down and potentially no longer able to afford a solar install, but there was some light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>A company called <a href="https://contact-solar.co.uk/">Contact Solar</a> had purchased the customer list and agreed to do what they could to help the customers that F4S had left in limbo and without their deposits. This was an absolutely brilliant thing for them to do for all these customers, however I had concerns that with reports of 1500+ customers they would struggle to keep up with the installs and I could be waiting months again, this really did unsettle me.</p><p>That said, I had no evidence that this was the case and Contact Solar provided a very competitive price and a good proposal based on the money left on the contract.</p><h2 id="decision-time"><span class="me-2">Decision Time</span><a href="#decision-time" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2><p>I now had to choose between <strong><a href="https://contact-solar.co.uk/">Contact Solar</a></strong></p><ul><li>24 x 405w JA Solar Panels<li>SunSynk 8kw Hybrid Inverter<li>10.64kWh Battery Storage</ul><p>or <strong><a href="https://esegroup.co.uk/">ese group</a></strong></p><ul><li>24 x 405w Longi Solar Panels<li>Lux Powertek LXP 7.6Kw Inverter<li>12.8kWh Greenlinx LXP LV-L3.2-1p battery storage<li>Pigeon proofing<li>15 Year maintenance plan</ul><p>As you can see both offered quite a good deal, with reputable equipment that integrate well with my Home Assistant and <a href="https://share.octopus.energy/topaz-moon-377">Octopus Energy</a></p><p>The main difference I found was the Depth of Discharge (DoD) on the SunSynk batteries was 90% but on Greenlinx batteries its 100%, plus the batteries are larger and the addition of the 15 year maintenance from ESE just made the deal a little better for me.</p><p>I also found ESE seemed to have more time to answer my questions, they would always call back when they said and were very helpful, with contact solar, it was all via email which had slow responses and there wasn’t much of a personal touch that made you feel like they wanted your business.</p><p>So as you can probably tell, my business went to <strong>ese group</strong></p><h2 id="sales-aftercare"><span class="me-2">Sales Aftercare</span><a href="#sales-aftercare" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2><p>On 1st June 2023 I was at the stage of paying a deposit, getting DNO Approval, scheduling the survey and installation dates.</p><p>After agreeing to continue I was passed over to make payment, recommended by ESE to pay by Credit Card for the added protection (I would have insisted on this anyway, but it was nice that they mentioned the added protection it offers and that it was their recommended payment method).</p><p>Once I had paid I was asked when I would like the install, I asked ASAP due to being so delayed from my previous provider. The install date provided was the 22nd June! not even 4 weeks and they could have the installation completed, crazy to think how long I had been waiting that they could do this so quick.</p><p>I agreed and was told I would get a call the following day to arrange a survey, sure enough at 09:30 I had a call to say that someone was in the area today doing another survey and could come do mine after, the surveyor came to check everything and said that it would either be him or one of the other members of the team that would carry out the install.</p><h2 id="the-install"><span class="me-2">The Install</span><a href="#the-install" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2><p>I have now had my install completed, the team came and had the inverter, batteries and 1st string of panels installed on the first day, on the second day they got the final string installed and everything was done. The job was very tidy and looks great.</p><p>I did have one issue where the battery kept draining itself and power usage was jumping all over the place, but on investigation I found that the CT Clamp was on upside down, easy mistake to make and it was easy enough for me to fix.</p><p>The electrician got the dongle hooked up to my WiFi and helped setup the app on my phone. I did however have to contact ESE as by default they don’t leave the ESS Greenlinx battery dongles in, this means its not possible to individually monitor the batteries and should this be required in the future I would be stuck if ESE went into administration. (I’m now waiting for these to be shipped to me)</p><h2 id="aftercare"><span class="me-2">Aftercare</span><a href="#aftercare" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="bi bi-hash"></i></a></h2><p>Generally ESE have been great, the install was quick and efficient.</p><p>However I do believe I was slightly miss-lead by them, I went with them as the contract stated I would be able to use any energy provider to get SEG payments via the flexi-orb certificate which they said is the same as MCS but an alternative.</p><p>The way this was worded lead me to believe I would be find with <strong>ANY</strong> energy supplier, that’s not the case, currently only 5 energy suppliers accept Flexi-orb and Octopus is not one of these.
