Rather than having to manually link to other articles related to the series, I thought it w... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Last4Solar - My solar nightmare!</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/last4solar-my-solar-nightmare/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Last4Solar - My solar nightmare!" /><published>2023-06-02T22:13:35+01:00</published> <updated>2023-06-02T22:13:35+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/last4solar-my-solar-nightmare/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/last4solar-my-solar-nightmare/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Grumblings" /> <summary> At the end of 2022 I came into some inheritance, with the massive energy price increase in the UK I decided to spend this money on a solar and battery installation on my house. With the decreasing price of solar systems and the increase in price, the return on investment is getting smaller and making the option much more reasonable. Choosing a company for the installation I spent a long time... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Automating deployments using Terraform with Proxmox and ansible</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/automating-proxmox-with-terraform-ansible/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automating deployments using Terraform with Proxmox and ansible" /><published>2023-05-06T10:03:29+01:00</published> <updated>2023-06-08T15:10:06+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/automating-proxmox-with-terraform-ansible/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/automating-proxmox-with-terraform-ansible/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Automation" /> <summary> Over the years my home lab has grown and become more and more difficult to maintain, especially because some servers I build and forget as they function so well. I have found recently though that moving to newer versions of operating systems can be difficult for the servers that I cant easily containerise at the moment. For this reason I have moved over to using Terraform with Proxmox and ans... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Use Python pandas NOW for your big datasets</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/use-python-pandas-now/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Use Python pandas NOW for your big datasets" /><published>2023-03-29T17:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2023-03-29T17:00:00+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/use-python-pandas-now/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/use-python-pandas-now/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Python" /> <summary> Over the past few years I have been working on processing large analytical data sets requiring various manipulations to produce statistics for analysis and business improvement. I quickly found that processing data of this size was slow, some taking over 11 hours to process which would only get worse as the data grew. Most of the processing required multiple nested for loops and addition of c... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>How I host this site</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/how-i-host-this-site/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How I host this site" /><published>2023-02-25T19:22:00+00:00</published> <updated>2023-02-25T21:51:13+00:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/how-i-host-this-site/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/how-i-host-this-site/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="how-to" /> <summary> My site isn’t anything special, but I thought I’d like to share how I create and host things for others who may be interested in sharing their own words with a very simple and easy to maintain structure. Motivation for hosting this site I have hosted a blog site in some form for the past 10+ years. The idea being to share my experience with others and hopefully help others with some of the is... </summary> </entry> </feed>
