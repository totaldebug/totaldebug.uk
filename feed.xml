Main Features Some of Homers main features are: Yaml file configuration Search Grouping Theme customisation Service Health Checks Keyboard shortcuts Configuration To begin configuration navigate to the homer data folder that we created ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Homer dashboard with Docker</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/homer-dashboard-with-docker/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Homer dashboard with Docker" /><published>2022-10-15T22:57:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-10-16T16:41:37+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/homer-dashboard-with-docker/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/homer-dashboard-with-docker/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Containers" /> <summary> Recently I have decided to get my home network in order, One of the things I realised was that I spend a lot of time trying to remember the IP addresses or URLs for services within my home, especially ones that I access infrequently. At one point I did have a dashboard that was HTML but I never updated it and I decided to remove it a year or so ago. After sitting on YouTube for a few hours wa... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Proxmox Template with Cloud Image and Cloud Init</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/proxmox-template-with-cloud-image-and-cloud-init/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Proxmox Template with Cloud Image and Cloud Init" /><published>2022-10-04T19:54:00+01:00</published> <updated>2022-10-27T11:20:59+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/proxmox-template-with-cloud-image-and-cloud-init/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/proxmox-template-with-cloud-image-and-cloud-init/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Automation" /> <summary> Using Cloud images and Cloud init with Proxmox is the quickest, most efficient way to deploy servers at this time. Cloud images are small cloud certified that have Cloud init pre-installed and ready to accept configuration. Cloud images and Cloud init also work with Proxmox and if you combine this with Terraform (more on that in my next article) you have a fully automated deployment model.

Specified by PEP 484 and then introduced to Python 3.5. Type hints help to structure your projects better, however they are just hints, they don’t impact the runtime. As your code base gets larger or you utilise unfamiliar libraries type hints can help with debugging and stopping mistakes ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Creating the perfect Python project</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/creating-the-perfect-python-project/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Creating the perfect Python project" /><published>2022-03-22T23:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-06-13T22:14:49+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/creating-the-perfect-python-project/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/creating-the-perfect-python-project/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Python" /> <category term="Code Quality" /> <summary> Working on a new project its always exciting to jump straight in and get coding without any setup time. However spending a small amount of time to setup the project with the best tools and practices will lead to a standardised and aligned coding experience for developers. In this article I will go through what I consider to be the best python project setup. Please follow along, or if you prefe... </summary> </entry> </feed>
