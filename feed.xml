At this time I haven’t implemented any automation, that will come in the future but for now I will show you how I integrated it with Home Assistant and implemented a nice card to display usage Lux Inverter Setup By default, the datalogger plugged... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>A Pythonic way to alias methods?</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/python-method-aliases/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Pythonic way to alias methods?" /><published>2023-08-08T10:39:37+01:00</published> <updated>2023-08-08T10:39:37+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/python-method-aliases/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/python-method-aliases/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Python" /> <summary> An alias method allows accesses to the original method via a different name. You can define your own alias method by adding the statement a = b to your class definition. This creates an alias method a() for the original method b(). For my situation this wasn’t really ideal, I wanted to standardise all of my method names easily with a deprecation warning when the old method was used. To do that... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Add series links to Jekyll posts</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/jekyll-post-series-links/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Add series links to Jekyll posts" /><published>2023-06-09T09:06:40+01:00</published> <updated>2023-08-08T09:20:30+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/jekyll-post-series-links/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/jekyll-post-series-links/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Website" /> <summary> Creating blog posts for my website I sometimes find that I want top create multiple articles as part of a series, usually because I have done some research and got to a stage that makes sense to have an article to itself, something like my recent post on Proxmox Template with Cloud Image and Cloud Init. Rather than having to manually link to other articles related to the series, I thought it w... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Last4Solar - My solar nightmare!</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/last4solar-my-solar-nightmare/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Last4Solar - My solar nightmare!" /><published>2023-06-02T22:13:35+01:00</published> <updated>2023-07-29T20:09:20+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/last4solar-my-solar-nightmare/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/last4solar-my-solar-nightmare/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Musings" /> <summary> At the end of 2022 I came into some inheritance, with the massive energy price increase in the UK I decided to spend this money on a solar and battery installation on my house. With the decreasing price of solar systems and the increase in price, the return on investment is getting smaller and making the option much more reasonable. Choosing a company for the installation I spent a long time... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Automating deployments using Terraform with Proxmox and ansible</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/automating-proxmox-with-terraform-ansible/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automating deployments using Terraform with Proxmox and ansible" /><published>2023-05-06T10:03:29+01:00</published> <updated>2023-08-08T09:20:30+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/automating-proxmox-with-terraform-ansible/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/automating-proxmox-with-terraform-ansible/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Automation" /> <summary> Over the years my home lab has grown and become more and more difficult to maintain, especially because some servers I build and forget as they function so well. I have found recently though that moving to newer versions of operating systems can be difficult for the servers that I cant easily containerise at the moment. For this reason I have moved over to using Terraform with Proxmox and ans... </summary> </entry> </feed>
