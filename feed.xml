This API Allows you to plan your PV usage and if you should use cheap rate grid power to charge batteries in preparation for a low solar day, also with the use of specific Home Assistant cards, you can see how much solar is left for the day. Setup Head over to Solcast and create a new account, selecting ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Integrating a Lux Power Inverter with Home Assistant</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/integrate-lux-inverter-with-home-assistant/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Integrating a Lux Power Inverter with Home Assistant" /><published>2023-08-08T12:05:51+01:00</published> <updated>2023-08-14T11:34:33+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/integrate-lux-inverter-with-home-assistant/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/integrate-lux-inverter-with-home-assistant/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Home Automation" /> <summary> After having solar installed I wanted to get it integrated into home assistant to enable historical monitoring and also automation around my home. At this time I haven’t implemented any automation, that will come in the future but for now I will show you how I integrated it with Home Assistant and implemented a nice card to display usage Lux Inverter Setup By default, the datalogger plugged... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>A Pythonic way to alias methods?</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/python-method-aliases/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Pythonic way to alias methods?" /><published>2023-08-08T10:39:37+01:00</published> <updated>2023-08-08T10:39:37+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/python-method-aliases/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/python-method-aliases/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Python" /> <summary> An alias method allows accesses to the original method via a different name. You can define your own alias method by adding the statement a = b to your class definition. This creates an alias method a() for the original method b(). For my situation this wasn’t really ideal, I wanted to standardise all of my method names easily with a deprecation warning when the old method was used. To do that... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Add series links to Jekyll posts</title><link href="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/jekyll-post-series-links/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Add series links to Jekyll posts" /><published>2023-06-09T09:06:40+01:00</published> <updated>2023-08-08T09:20:30+01:00</updated> <id>https://totaldebug.uk/posts/jekyll-post-series-links/</id> <content src="https://totaldebug.uk/posts/jekyll-post-series-links/" /> <author> <name>Steven Marks</name> </author> <category term="Website" /> <summary> Creating blog posts for my website I sometimes find that I want top create multiple articles as part of a series, usually because I have done some research and got to a stage that makes sense to have an article to itself, something like my recent post on Proxmox Template with Cloud Image and Cloud Init. Rather than having to manually link to other articles related to the series, I thought it w... </summary> </entry> </feed>
