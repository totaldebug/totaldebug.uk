Hi, Im **Steve** a Full Stack Systems Engineer from [Leeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds), UK.

I created this website to provide a location where I could share articles related to my interests / findings
when working as a Developer / Solution Architect.

My interest in IT started when I was very young, my Uncle worked for a large IT company and I was always fascinated
by his work. I would build my own computers with him and eventually built them for friends and family too.

I started my career in IT straight from high school where I had an apprenticeship with Kodak working in one of their
datacenters, I then moved on to working for small IT Resellers and then on to a small Leeds based data center /
hosting provider where I honed my skills and continued to expand my knowledge.

Now working for one of the worlds largest service providers, I spend my time working on projects to ensure
the business runs in the most efficient ways possible by implementing automation tooling and improving processes.
