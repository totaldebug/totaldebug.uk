Hi, I'm **Steve**, a Full Stack, Cloud Engineer from [Leeds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds), UK.

By day, I'm a **Full Stack & Infrastructure Engineer at Periphery Security**, a cybersecurity startup on a mission to secure the Internet of Things. My role is to design and build the full-stack platform that powers our tiny, AI-driven embedded agent. This means I get to work on everything from the cloud infrastructure and backend APIs to the frontend our customers use.

### Why TotalDebug?

This site is my digital notebook and workshop. It's where I share my findings, "how-to" guides, and solutions from the trenches of software development, systems automation, and now, cybersecurity.

If you're passionate about optimising workflows, building scalable infrastructure, or just seeing how tech can be broken down and rebuilt, you're in the right place.

### The Backstory

My interest in IT started young, building computers with my uncle for friends and family. I dove straight into the industry from high school with an apprenticeship at Kodak.

That first role in a datacenter kicked off a journey through IT resellers, hosting providers, and eventually, a long stint at one of the world's largest service providers. There, I honed my skills in architecture and automation, building the tools and processes to make large-scale systems run efficiently.

Now, I'm applying that same passion for building and automating to the new and exciting challenge of protecting IoT devices.
